# HomeMatic-Open-Central-Control-Unit-SDK (HM-OCCU-SDK)

## WARNING

With version `3.41.x` changes have been implemented to improve the security of the CCU3 software. These changes can rarely lead to problems with 3rd party software. The following changes have been made:

- Firewall settings are now more restrictive by default and can be changed via an extended configuration dialog.
- optional user / password query for API access via HTTP/HTTPS (XML-RPC, Homematic Script)

## CPU Support

The HM-OCCU-SDK contains several binary packages for different CPU architectures.
The CPU architectures are tested on the following hardware:

subfolder `arm-gnueabihf`:

- Raspberry Pi
- Cubietruck (Cubian)

subfolder `X86_32`:

- Debian Wheezy

subfolder `mips` _(outdated)_:

- vu+ soloÂ² with vti Image

The script `install.sh` in the CPU specific subfolder copies all binary packages
to `/opt/hm`.
This script is just an example and can be enhanced by the community. Some Linux
distributions like OpenELEC have a readonly root filesystem, so the
installation script must be changed (replace `/opt/hm` by `/storage/hm`).

Further CPU specific information can be found in the CPU architecture specific
subfolder.

## Binary Packages

Each CPU subfolder contains the following binary packages:

- subfolder packages-eQ-3/RFD: Radio Frequency Daemon
- subfolder packages-eQ-3/HS485D: (wired) HS485 Daemon
- subfolder packages-eQ-3/WebUI: pre-alpha many CCU2 specific functions must be replaced
- subfolder packages/lighttpd: preconfigured HTTP daemon

## Supported communication devices

- HM-LGW-O-TW-W-EU LAN Gateway
- HM-CFG-LAN (limited support, OTAU (Over The Air Updates) not possible)
- HMW-LGW-O-DR-GS-EU Wired LAN Gateway
- HM-Cfg-USB-2 (experimental, not official supported)
- HM-MOD-RPI-PCB
- HmIP-RFUSB (HmIP only)

## CCU2 Toolchain

With the CCU2 toolchain it is possible to compile C/C++ programms and build
installable CCU2 add-ons.
It is also possible to build CCU2 images with additional software, e.g. the
Email add-on, which can be installed as normal CCU2 updates.

## Support

The HM-OCCU-SDK is provided free of charge. If you want any commercial support
please contact `support@eq-3.de`.
